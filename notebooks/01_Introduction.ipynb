    "\n",
    "Much of science, and especially psychology and neuroscience, involves testing and updating verbal theories, which are often imprecise and under-specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "Only by quantitative modeling of our experimental results can we hope to make significant progress in understanding the mechanisms that underlie cognition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, only by quantifying and defining knowledge via mathematical principles can we achieve the effective interdisciplinary communication necessary for combining approaches to make useful progress towards understanding a system as complex as the brain. \n",
    "\n",
    "This course aims to equip students with the skills to:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. think more deeply about the mechanisms underlying observed neural and behavioral phenomena, improving scientific thinking, and\n",
    "\n",
    "b. develop computational models that enable more precise, quantifiably testable, hypotheses, improving the scientific process. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the course will be taught at a high level, the goal is to provide practical hands-on examples for every topic, to lay the foundation necessary to understand, develop, and compare mechanistic models of cognition."
